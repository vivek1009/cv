      'request time at server', 'network latency', 'Memory/ CPU utilization' during peak load time among
      others.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented feature that leverage SOA Auto Recovery to automatically recover from infra-structure
      related faults and allowing Administrators to take corrective action to rectify faults arising due to setup,
      configuration, or business rules related issues. This helped teams in reducing Service Requests (~80%
